# Code Wars Practice
##### By Jackson Stenger
## Details
##### These are my solutions to problems from codewars.com. I used Python 3 for all of my solutions.
## Background
##### I just got into a coding bootcamp called Galvanize, and I'm trying to brush up on my python skillz before camp starts in March. I was recommended codewars.com by my Galvanize interviewer. It's super fun.
